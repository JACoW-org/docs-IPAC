# Glossary

The workflow of all IPAC conferences is pretty much the same, regardless of the tools used to manage contributions (SPMS or Indico). However, terminology varies. 
Here follows an explanation and mapping of the terms that appear in SPMS and Indico.

| SPMS                             | Indico                                      |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Main Classification (MC)         | Track Group                                 |
| Sub Classification               | Track                                       |
| Abstract                         | Abstract                                    |
| Accepted abstract                | Contribution                                |
| Review                           | Comment, propose track change/accept/...    |
| Judge                            | Accept / Reject / Mark as duplicate / Merge |
| SPC member reviewing proposed MC | Reviewer *and* Convener                     |
| MC Coordinator                   | Convener++ (*having judging permission*)    |

- **Reviewers** provide an assessment of the abstract with their review, and they can consult only their own reviews

- **Conveners** can read all reviews 

- **Judges** can effectively accept or reject an abstract based on the feedback left by the Reviewers (admins, Conveners++)
