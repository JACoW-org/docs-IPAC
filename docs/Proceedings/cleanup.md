# Cleanup

The creation of the proceedings by CAT generates not only the proceedings package on the server where MEOW runs. The compressed archive to be downloaded and a lot of intermediate files are created as well.

All these files occupy a huge amount of space on the server. For this reason it is important, after the proceedings have been published, to remove these files by way of the cleanup tool in CAT.

To access this feature open the "Show info" panel from CAT's plugin dashboard:

then use the "Clear" button at the bottom right corner of the window:

Please note that this process is non-reversible: proceedings need to be regenerated if needed to access again them.
