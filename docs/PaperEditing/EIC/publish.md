# Publishing

Once an editable is on status “Accepted”, it needs to pass the final QA 
before being moved to status “Published”. This is shown by a “QA02: QA 
Pending” yellow tag assigned to the editable.

Only members of the **SCS** (Scientific Secretariat) role can then proceed with the final QA and move the editable to the final “Published” state.

If the Scientific Secretary chooses “Fail QA” then the editable is moved back to the “Ready for review” status.

If the Scientific Secretary chooses “Approve QA” then the editable is moved to the final “QA01: QA Approved” tag.

See also the [detailed instructions for the QA Editor](../../Editor/QA/). It also explains the various statuses (i.e., *to be QA'd*, *QA OK*, *QA failed*)

**Note:** You can name the Scientific Secretariat Role as you like, as long its code is "**SCS**"
