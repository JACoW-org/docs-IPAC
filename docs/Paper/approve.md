# Approving a new version of the file

Editors can also edit the files themselves and upload the result. In 
this case the status of your contribution turns to “Needs Confirmation”,
 you are alerted by email and you are requested to validate their 
changes through the interface.

If **you reject the changes**, you will be asked to make the changes yourself, see the previous section.

If **you accept the changes**,
 the contribution is moved to the “Accepted” status and the editing is 
nearly over (it will go through a final QA process by the scientific 
secretariat).
