# Communicating with reviewers

For the IPAC LPR exercise the reviewers are anonymous. The LPR manager, following the Scientific Publication Board decisions, will eventually reject, accept or ask for a modification of the submitted paper. 

**The author, at any moment, can communicate with the reviewers by way of the comments area in the LPR dashboard:**

If the LPR manager will request a modification of the paper, the author will be able to submit a revised version from the dashboard:

Only the name of the LPR manager will be shown in the dashboard timeline.
