# Accepting proposals for invited oral presentations by MC Coordinators during SPC/2

---

*This is an explanation for the Scientific Programme Committee MC Coordinators (SPC-MCC) on how to perform the **last steps of the [workflow for the Submission of Proposals for Invited Oral Presentations](intro.md#normal-ipac-workflow)**.*

---

Before the SPC/2 meeting the MC Coordinators will work on the abstracts reviewed by the SPC, usually starting from an [export prepared by the Scientific Secretariat](SStipsandtricks.md#1-get-a-spreadsheet-summary-of-reviews). Every coordinator will propose a set of abstracts, together with a number of backups, to the SPC/2 for final discussion and approval. 

During SPC/2 the SPC will discuss all the proposals and eventually accept those that will actually be invited.

Every MC Coordinator will act in their assigned Track and work through all of the proposals to be accepted, then "judging" them, i.e. accepting them as invited orals, in the correct track. 

After clicking on an abstract title, at the bottom the *judging area* will appear:

*MC Coordinators should carefully read the judgement instructions available before judging. Special requirements may be present for the specific IPAC.*

---

Similarly as before, there are four options for the judgement:

- **Accept** 

- *Reject*

- *Mark as duplicate*

- *Merge*

We suggest to *only use the first option, Accept*, in case the SPC agrees on this abstract to become an invited oral presentation. All the other can be left without any judgement and eventually be deleted afterwards by the Scientific Secretariat.

The **other fields can (and should) be left unchanged** - this way the track and contribution type will remain the same as set before.

We also recommend to **deselect the "*Send notifications to submitter*"** checkbox - otherwise an email will be sent to the person that originally proposed the abstract.

---

Alternatively, this job can be left to the Scientific Secretariat who can work through the accepted abstracts via the Management Area and "judge" on behalf of the MC Coordinators.
